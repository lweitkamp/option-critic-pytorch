# Option Critic
This repository is a PyTorch implementation of the paper "The Option-Critic Architecture" by Pierre-Luc Bacon, Jean Harb and Doina Precup [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05140). It is mostly a rewriting of the original Theano code found [here](https://github.com/jeanharb/option_critic) into PyTorch, focused on readability and ease of understanding the logic begind the Option-Critic.


## CartPole
Currently, the dense architecture can learn CartPole-v0 with a learning rate of 0.005, this has however only been tested with two options. (I dont see any reason to use more than two in the cart pole environment.) the current runs directory holds the training results for this env with 0.005 and 0.006 learning rates. Run it as follows:

```
python main.py
```

## Atari Environments
I suspect it will take a grid search over learning rate to work on Pong and such. Just supply the right `--env` argument and the model should switch to convolutions if the environment is Atari compatible.

## Four Room experiment
There are plenty of resources to find a numpy version of the four rooms experiment, this one is a little bit different; represent the state as a one-hot encoded vector, and learn to solve this grid world using a deep net. Run this experiment as follows

```
python main.py --switch-goal True --env fourrooms
```

## Requirements
Tested on python 3.7
```
pytorch>=1.12.1
tensorboard>=2.0.2
gym>=0.15.3
```
